<h3> Verbal. Vocal. Visual </h3>

<b>Barriers to effective communication</b>
-	Personal - someone you take a dislike to, that you need to get past professionally
-	Physical – body language,
-	Geographical – remote working

-	Organisational – unclear organisation structures, unclear power structure

### How to be a good communicator

<b>Body Language</b>
-	Sit or stand at right angles on the same level
-	Respect personal space
-	Use open gestures
-	Focus on the other person
-	Lean in to show interest
-	Learn further to apply pressure
-	Lean back to relax
-	Maintain appropriate eye contact
-	Relax

<b>Four stages of listening</b>
-	Cosmetic (not really listening)
-	Conversational (responding and acknowledging the speaker)
-	Active (Focussed on the speaker, mentally aware of their body language etc)
-	Deep (Deeper level of the above)

Use open questions to gather more information from a question, instead of using closed questions with a one-word answer. However, if you are trying to close down a conversation or set out the next steps.

Open question examples:

```
- What led to that?
- In what ways was your business trip successful?
```

Closing question examples:
```
- When shall we three meet again? In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
- What needs to be done going ahead from here
```

These questions can be used to build rapport with others, allowing you to work towards different oppertunities regardless of position.


# Situational Management

<b>Causes of Conflict</b>
-	Miscommunication
-	Differing goals or priorities
-	Stress
-	Resource limitation – Contested terrain
-	Personality clash
-	Styles of thinking and working
-	Difference in values, beliefs and opinions.


<b>Handling Situations</b>

-	Take time to understand the situation
  - Listen to their view before reacting
-	Know your audience
   - Are they a “know-it-all”, or closed-minded?
	 - Knowing that should change the way you deal with them
-	Ask others for their perspective
  - Gain viewpoints from outside of the bubble
-	Compromise
o	Find a resolution to satisfy both parties if you can
o	It’s fine to capitulate – this is not a battle

Sometimes you just need to walk away.

-	Stay calm
-	Listen
-	Treat them with respect
-	DON’T push blame
-	Take responsibility – you may also be wrong
-	Adjust body language/tone of voice to best suit the situation

Neuro-linguistic programming – mapping a sense to a memory or image.

This is beneficial because you can think clearer, communicate more effectively, and even handle anxiety and phobias
